Why Scala is the best and why not -- call for comments

My post on Scala([1]) and similar posts elsewhere sparked quite a few critical comments.

I'm happy to be able to use Scala. It gives me access to abstractions that are not commonly found:

- HKT and other "sexy types" ([2]) provide abstractions strong enough to model problems with precision.
- Precise types open the way to rule-based code derivation via using/given.
- I find the syntax extremely nice and getting better.
- Great scalable metaprogramming capabilities, starting from inline all the way down to staged metaprogramming.
- On the tooling side, Metals + scala-cli do a great job.
- I have plenty of deployment options: the JVM, which is an absolutely great platform to target with an enormous amount of libraries available; browsers/JavaScript (and WebAssembly soon); native via Scala Native or GraalVM.
- Library ecosystems to choose from (typelevel.org being my favorite).

The critique points I hear most are in the poll questions.

I greatly appreciate your points on this. Please consider adding "compared to…"

Hopefully, I can address some questions, or we can all gather some insights and alternatives.

Thank you.
