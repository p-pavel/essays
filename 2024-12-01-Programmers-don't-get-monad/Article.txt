Do you personally know a programmer who "doesn't get monads"?

If so, how is that even possible? Monads have been part of programming since Haskell '98, and languages like Scala support higher-kinded types (HKT), allowing monads to be expressed directly.

Optional types, asynchronous computations, and generators—features now common in mainstream languages—are all unmistakably monadic constructions.

Do people who haven’t taken even one weekend during their professional career to understand the simple concept of composing dependent computations really exist? Why?!

Are they truly so busy that they can’t allocate a few hours to learn this?

I don't get it.
