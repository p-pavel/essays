# The mythical "business values"

When I hear the words "business values" from software people, I immediately think of a manipulation attempt.

Are you a business owner? Did the CTO come to you with the translation of those business values into practices and tools? Paradoxically, these references can be heard more frequently from juniors to seniors, in my experience.

People occupying decision-making roles tend to "mind their own business" (and I mean producing quality software).

What are those business values?

The best you can say is: "Software should be delivered fast, not require much in the way of resources to develop and run, work as expected, require no maintenance, allow for reuse and extension, and provide structure to the problem domain."

And we all know that all those goals can't be achieved simultaneously.

The properties above may or may not directly translate to business operations. For example, the purpose of the business might be exploiting a long-term government contract, with little concern for producing meaningful technical results. In such cases, the software development department exists only to fulfill a requirement on paper. Or the goal could be to produce an MVP and sell the business, without concern for maintenance or extensibility.

Starting with the desired properties of software systems and components (and not mythical "business values"), we can begin talking about the desired properties of our tools and practices—while staying within what is known in our engineering discipline—not religiously referring to "business values" we can't robustly relate our practices to.

That said, not much is known or quantified in software engineering compared to better-established fields. The impact of specific tools and practices on the overall process is hard to quantify, and the rapid pace of change makes gathering meaningful data nearly impossible.

If you've ever been told "we do this because of business values," ask yourself—or your superior—what those values really mean in practice. I’d love to hear what you find in the comments, or feel free to share this post with them.

After 30 years as a developer—including almost 20 years in leadership roles—I’ve learned to question slogan-like statements. What’s your experience?
