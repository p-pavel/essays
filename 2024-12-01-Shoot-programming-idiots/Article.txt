I looked up some data and it turns out like there're 28-30 million programmers in the world with 1.2-1.5 millions more coming to the profession yearly.

If we start shooting a couple of thousands programming idiots claiming things they have no idea about (nor can even trace where they got that crap from) DAILY, we will never run out of them.

They somehow manage to reproduce faster.
