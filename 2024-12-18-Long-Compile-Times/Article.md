# What are long compile times?

"Long compile times" was one of main the driving forces
behind creation of #Go([1]) and fast compilation is still praised by people
restricting themself to it.

I also keep hearing about long compile times as a counter-argument against #Scala
(though I personally don't have any problems at all with compile times)

So what are we talking about here? What numbers are considered "long" compile time?

What codebases people are working with and why they need to be recompiled and
how often?

For me most of the compilations happens while I'm typing in IDE by
LSP server, and occasionally when I'm packaging the artifact.

What's your experience? What are the numbers? What are the codebases?
Can't the problem lie in the codebase quality
(everything depends on everything and not on the stable interfaces)?
